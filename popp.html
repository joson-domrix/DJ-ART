  <div class="panel-body">If you're not familiar with the term, you've certainly seen the style. Simple geometric shapes placed side-by-side to create angular, often minimalist, compositions. The “poly” from low poly comes from the word “polygon,” which is merely a 2-dimensional shape made of straight lines and angles.</div>

    <ul><li>Lock the layer with the photo in the Layers panel in order not to move it in the process.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>On top of the first layer create a new layer. We will be working in this layer. Now take the Pen Tool (P) and create a facial contour.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>With the Pen Tool (P) create neck outline and hair.</li></ul>   
    <ul><li>Getting to the creation of eyes. Take the Pen Tool (P) and create a path that reproduces the outlines of the eyes and the shape of the shadow around it (I have filled this shape with red for better visibility).</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Creation of eyes is the most important work, because we see human eyes every day, and any imbalance will be immediately noticed. I would suggest you to rely more on your feelings than on the photo. Take the Ellipse Tool (L) and create a circle with a blue fill and black stroke.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>This circle will be iris. Take the Scissors Tool (C) and cut the circle at points A and B, then remove the top of the circle.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Now connect the points A and B using the Pen Tool (P) as shown in the figure below.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Using the same technique, create a pupil.</ul></li>
    <ul><li>Based on the photo, create the elements of the mouth. The teeth are filled with solid white color — this is the style of works by Roy Lichtenstein. As with the overall graphic, simplify the outline by reproducing only the significant outlines in the underlying photo.</ul></li>
    <ul><li>Now create the folds of skin around the eyes and nose, using the Pen Tool (P) and profiles from the Stroke panel.</ul></li>
    <ul><li>Start creating stylized hair. The task is not simple, since Marilyn has a fairly elaborate hairstyle. In this work, the main thing is to differentiate locks of hair and to understand their direction. I printed a few portraits of Marilyn and tried to create a few pencil sketches.</ul></li>
    <ul><li>A characteristic feature of Roy Lichtenstein works is an exaggerated imitation of the halftone print pattern. This style is called the Ben-Day dots. With the Phantasm CS plugin installed (click here to download a full 7 day trial version), we can easily replicate this effect and even experiment a bit. Copy the shape of the face and neck and paste them in front (CMD / Ctrl + C; CMD / Ctrl + F), fill them with maroon color, and unite them into one shape by clicking the Unite button from the Pathfinder panel.</ul></li>
    <ul><li>Keep the object selected, go to Effect > Phantasm CS > Halftone…. The dialog window contains a variety of options allowing the fine-tuning of the effect.</ul></li>
    <ul><li>We just have to create the background. For the background we will use a paper photo texture. You can download such textures here (credit to deviantART user ~Knald). Paste the texture into the artwork (File > Place …) and set the Multiply Blending Mode for it in the Transparency panel.</ul></li>
